    <p>Name: Amenti</p>
    <p>Ganre: Horror </p>
    <br>
    <p>Amenti was a nice short game to play trough, I had lots of fun with the jumpscares and the story which altough there could have been done more with it, was fun.</p>
    <p>The notes you found along the way where whity and the exploration of the tomb was dope.</p>
    <p>Aside from a few, in my opinion, unnecessary things like the pilar jumping part and the 'you're dead' sound effect/art, for the 8 euro's I payed this was well worth it.</p>
    <p>Watch the video for a more detailed explaination on my toughts of it, but overal this game, for the money you pay for it gets a 7.5 out of 10! </p>
